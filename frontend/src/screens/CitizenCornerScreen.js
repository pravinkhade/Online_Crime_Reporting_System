    <h4 >- Vehicle Theft</h4><br/>
    <h5>&#8226; WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO</h5>
   
    <p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8594;&nbsp; Never leave the vehicle door unlocked, nor the windows partially open. Make sure that the <br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quarter glasses are properly secured. Do not leave valuables inside the car, even if it is <br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; locked, as this will attract thieves. Do not overdo extra fittings, as these tempt prospective <br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thieves Never leave the key dangling in the ignition.</p>
   
    <br/>
    <h5>&#8226; WHAT YOU SHOULD DO…</h5>
   
    <p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8594;&nbsp; Use securing devices like steering lock, clutch lock, brake lock, etc. Double-check all doors, <br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;including the boot if possible, install loud alarm systems in your car, so that thieves can be <br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; discouraged even if they manage to break into your car. Try and use detachable music <br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; systems and take them with you whenever you park the car for a long time, so that there is<br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no temptation for thieves to make a quick steal when they see expensive items in parked<br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cars. Paint your car number on the front and rear end of the body, apart from the number<br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plates. Ideally, have it etched on the windscreens and window glasses too. This prevents <br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;them from being misused by criminals using fake number plates.</p>
